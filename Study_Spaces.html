            <h2>Welcome to Study Spaces at U-M!</h2>
            <p> At the University of Michigan, Study Spaces is here to help you easily find and reserve study areas, computer stations, or quiet spots for remote classes.
            While some spaces may still require reservations, many are now available for walk-in use. As we move into the new academic year, youâ€™ll find both reservable and open study spaces across campus,
            including the Library's mix of walk-in and bookable areas. This site aims to guide you to the most suitable options for your study needs,
            though it may not include every available space on campus.</p>
            <article>
                <h3>Explore Available Study Spaces</h3>
                    <p>Explore the different avilable study spaces on U-M's campus. From options on North Campus, to the Libraries on campus, find a space that's perfect for you. Space reservations are aviable for open spaces, but many have walk-in availabilities as well.</p>
                    <p>While you peruse, keep these points in mind for each space:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Please be aware this site is not an exhaustive list of study spaces.</li>
                        <li>Many Campus spaces are back to full availability.</li>
                        <li>Spaces at the Library are walk-in while Study Spaces are reconfigured with reservable space. Currently, there are 1st floor tables and 2nd floor reservable rooms. The Library will be a mix of walk-in and bookable spaces.</li>
