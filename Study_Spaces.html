            <h2>Welcome to Study Spaces at U-M!</h2>
            <p>At the University of Michigan, Study Spaces is here to help you easily find and reserve study areas, computer stations, or quiet spots for remote classes.
            While some spaces may still require reservations, many are now available for walk-in use. As we move into the new academic year, youâ€™ll find both reservable and open study spaces across campus,
            including the Library's mix of walk-in and bookable areas. This site aims to guide you to the most suitable options for your study needs,
            though it may not include every available space on campus.</p>

                <h3>Explore Available Study Spaces</h3>
                    <p>Explore the different available study spaces on U-M's campus. From options on North Campus to the Libraries, find a space that's perfect for you. Space reservations are available for open spaces, but many have walk-in availabilities as well.</p>
                    <p>While you peruse, keep these points in mind for each space:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This site is not an exhaustive list of study spaces.</li>
                        <li>Many campus spaces are back to full availability.</li>
                        <li>The Library offers both walk-in and reservable spaces, such as 1st-floor tables and 2nd-floor rooms. The Library provides a mix of walk-in and bookable areas.</li>
